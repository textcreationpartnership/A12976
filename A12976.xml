         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7860:3"/> people of Iſrael to bring their offerings and gifts for the erecting and building of the Tabernacle. Whereof ſome brought more rich, ſumptuous, and coſtly gifts, as Gold, Siluer, Eare-rings, Rings, and Bracelets, all being Iewels of Gold. Some more meane, baſe, and of leſſe value, worth, and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; as Rammes skins, Badgers skins, Goates haire, and ſuch like: all which they did performe and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, ſo willingly, readily, chearefully, and freely; that they brought too much, and more then was ſufficient for
<pb facs="tcp:7860:3"/> the ſeruice of this Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">Exo. 36.5.7</note> and the vſe of the worke of the Tabernacle which the Lord commanded to be made. This moſt notable, rare, and admirable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their willing hearts and minds, in ſeruing God with their earthly goods: I haue propounded to my ſelfe to be imitated and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in a two-fold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: Firſt, for conſolation; herein comforting my ſelfe, that God who accepted their meaneſt offerings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the building of an earthly Sanctuarie, will much more accept, allow,
<pb facs="tcp:7860:4"/> and approue of this Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all offering which ſo volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily and cheerefully I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow to the glory of God, &amp; furtherance of the worke of his Spirituall Sanctuary; for God doth loue a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Giuer, and regardeth more the heart in giuing, then the gift it ſelfe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for inſtruction, teaching mee not to burie my gifts and Talents in the Earth, with that euill and ſlothfull Seruant mentioned of, in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.25.</note> but to put them forth, and imploy them to the vſe and benefit of Gods people, the good of his

            <p>Sir, to this end therefore I haue written this little Booke. Firſt, to admoniſh ſome kinde of people, (who for lacke of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, neuer feeling other daies then theſe, full of peace and quietneſſe) that thereby they might learne the better to apply vnto themſelues whatſoeuer they ſhall heare or reade of the tryall of GODS Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, leſt falſely imagining the ſame to appertaine
<pb facs="tcp:7860:5"/> either to the times that are paſt, or to other Nations, it fall ſuddenly vpon them as a Thiefe in the night, and they be deſtitute of all hope and comfort. Laſt of all, to comfort another ſort whom it hath pleaſed God to preſſe downe with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and to exerciſe with the continuall afflictions &amp; calamities of this Mortall life, as no times ſeeming fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable vnto them; they can ſcarſe receiue the words of any comfort. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as euery one in his calling is bound to doe ſome thing to the furtherance of the holy
<pb facs="tcp:7860:5"/> building. I haue according to my duty brought my poore basket of ſtones to the ſtrengthening of the walls of that Ieruſalem, whereof by grace we are all both Cittizens and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And heere I preſent vnto your Honor this poore Talent of mine: which may it pleaſe you to accept at my hands, as at one that wiſheth all happineſſe to you and yours in the Lord. Your Honours acceptation ſhall be my ſole ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the bond of my dutie hath this onely bound of my hope; humbly crauing
<pb facs="tcp:7860:6"/> that your fauourable wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome would ſupply the wants of this thing: and that this ſo ſimple a gift may be accepted of you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for my good meaning, and the end whereof I do it, then for the value of the thing it ſelfe: If you iudge them worthy, vouchſafe them I pray you your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage: if not, your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; at leaſt your gracious and fauourable acceptance, according to the kindneſſe of your nature and wonted courteſie in other matters. The which thing if you will bee pleaſed to doe, it
<pb facs="tcp:7860:6"/> ſhall not onely greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce mine heart, but make mee much indebted vnto you for the ſame. The Lord for his Sonnes ſake graunt that this labour of mine may bee accepted of the Saints, and tend vnto Gods glorie: and I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſeech the Lord, the GOD of all Grace, and Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of all Bleſſings, that hee would multiply his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Grace vpon you and yours, that you may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies walke worthy of the Lord, and pleaſe him in all things. Thus crauing pardon for my boldneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:7860:7"/> I humbly take my leaue. The God of heauen giue you that bleſſing of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, few men haue, that you may goe on from Grace to Grace, and be a long time happie in this life, and for euer happy in the life to come.</p>

                  <p>Hence wee learne that <hi>it is our dutie to binde our ſelues by ſolemne couenant &amp; promiſe to God;</hi>

Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when wee would expreſſe the cruelty or malice of any towards vs, we are wont to ſay, <hi>he hateth mee ſo deadly, that hee could finde in his heart to eate mee, or ſwallow mee vp quicke:</hi> the Prophet meaneth then that their enemies were ſo many and ſo mighty, that they needed no armour or weapons to deſtroy them, but were able like fierce and cruell beaſts, to ſwallow them vp aliue, being ſo weake and ſo little a flocke; let vs learne then to ſing with <hi>Dauid; If the Lord had not bin on our ſide,</hi> whoſe mighty hand hath deliuered vs, whoſe power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hath preſerued vs: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, this teacheth vs to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and meditate of all ſuch graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deliuerances, which he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto vs either in general or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; from <hi>treaſons, trecheries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies,</hi> &amp; the like: in regard wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we had long ſince bin conſumed had not God taken our parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that roſe vp againſt vs, whoſe purpoſe was to haue deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs: in regard of which <hi>treaſon</hi> we may truly ſay as <hi>Dauid:</hi> &amp; now may <hi>England</hi> ſay, <hi>If the Lord had not been on our ſide, if the Lord himſelfe had not bin on our ſide, when men roſe vp
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7860:22"/> againſt vs,</hi> viz. the Papiſts, <hi>they had then ſwallowed vs vp quick,</hi> when their wrath was kindled againſt vs, &amp;c. Let vs againe remember how nere their purpoſe hath bin broght to paſſe, ready euen to take effect, as we haue ſpoken in the 1. verſe, &amp; yet <hi>their net is broken,</hi> and wee are <hi>deliuered.</hi> This will make vs to hate and abandon all ſinne, which are the cauſe for the moſt part of al his puniſhments,<note place="margin">Lam. 3.39.</note> this will make vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to diſpleaſe God by any one ſin, fearing leſt he ſhould iuſtly giue vs ouer vnto the wil of our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: this will make vs to fly to him for help &amp; ſuccor, to depend vpon him, to ſeek by all meanes to come into his loue and fauour, <hi>Leaſt his wrath be kindled, and ſo wee periſh from the right way:</hi> in a word this will be a ſpeciall meanes to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en vs to the performance of all
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7860:23"/> dutifull obedience vnto our good God, who hath been ſo gracious and mercifull to vs, thus to deliuer vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we muſt call to minde often our <hi>perils</hi> by <hi>land,</hi> by <hi>water,</hi> by <hi>fire,</hi> at <hi>home</hi> and <hi>abroade;</hi> our danger in <hi>ſickeneſſe</hi> and <hi>diſeaſes:</hi> &amp; how many wayes God could plague vs: with ſtrange and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous viſitations, as the <hi>ſtone</hi> and <hi>chollicke,</hi> the <hi>frencie, madneſſe</hi> and manifold <hi>deſtructions:</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all which the Lord hath graciouſly preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs. We muſt remember Gods mercy in preſeruing of vs in our conception, in our birth, in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, youth, middle age, old age, and how he hath continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for vs all things neceſſary, whereas hee might iuſtly for our ſinnes haue ſufferd vs to ſtarue and and famiſh for want of foode: infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7860:23"/> are Gods works in preſeruing of vs, which neuer ought to ſlip out of our mindes, but to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured vp in faithfull memories, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that <hi>God and none but he doth all things for vs:</hi> and who therefore would abuſe this bounty and goodneſſe of God, and not rather as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, <hi>Be moued by theſe to forſake our ſinnes, and turne to God by true repentance:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 2.4.5.</note> being led, as it were, by theſe to returne the more ſpeedily vnto God.</p>
                  <p>Here firſt wee are to conſider how great things God hath done for our <hi>ſoules,</hi> how he hath kept vs from the <hi>ſpirituall famine,</hi> in giuing vs his word, to bee ſo plainely and plentifully taught: how hee hath kept vs from <hi>the powre and ſnare of the diuell:</hi> how hee hath pulled vs out of the dungeon of hell: and

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 24.2.</note> ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>affections,</hi> renewing our <hi>wils;</hi> rectified our <hi>reaſons,</hi> pacified our troubled <hi>conſciences,</hi> aſſwaged the maledy of our <hi>minds:</hi> how hee hath kept vs from the power and dominion of ſinne: <hi>of children of wrath, he hath made vs heires of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> he hath not onely giuen vs his <hi>Sonne,</hi> to be our <hi>Sauiour,</hi> but his <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> to aſſure vs, and his <hi>Sacraments</hi> to ſeale the aſſurance of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in our hearts: he hath <hi>elected, called, iuſtified</hi> and <hi>ſanctified</hi> vs: and many gracious promiſes hath hee made, from which he will neuer go back; that vndoubtedly he will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie vs; he gaue vs power ouer ſin
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7860:24"/> and Sathan in our conuerſion: he hath giuen vs ſtrength from time to time to withſtand the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>world,</hi> the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>diuell,</hi> ſo that wee may truely ſay, <hi>What could the Lord haue done more for his Vineyard? the Lord hath not dealt ſo with euery Nation, neither had the Heathen ſuch knowledge of his Lawes.</hi> O that men would wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider theſe things, it would make them leaue ſinning, &amp; moue them to exerciſe themſelues, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating day and night to liue ſo, and to pleaſe God. <hi>O my people</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>What wrong haue I done vnto thee? or wherein haue I wearied thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Micah. 6.4, 5, 6</note> 
                     <hi>teſtifie againſt mee? I haue deliuered thee, redeemed thee, and ſent before thee</hi> Moſes, Aaron, <hi>and</hi> Meriam <hi>i. Miniſter and Magiſtrate, O my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, remember now, &amp;c.</hi> and this with <hi>Dauid,</hi> this will make vs cry out and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7860:25"/> ſay, <hi>Come, and I will tell you what the Lord hath done for my ſoule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, we muſt remember the manner how God hath thus preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs both in body and ſoule: and that hath beene extraordinarily for the moſt part, on Gods part, and vndeſeruedly alwayes on our part, extraordinary on Gods part, as in thoſe manifold <hi>treaſons</hi> and <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries,</hi> beyond all expectation: when there haue beene no way as we might thinke for vs to eſcape, when they haue beene ready to put in execution their wicked <hi>deuiſes;</hi> then hath God awaked, as one out of ſleepe, to reſcue and deliuer vs, and that miraculouſly diſcouering their hidden treacheries, as wee haue ſhewed before: which the world knew not of.<note place="margin">Pſal. 107.</note> 
                     <hi>O that men would therfore remember to praiſe the Lord for his goodneſſe, and declare his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7860:25"/> wondrous workes to the Children of men.</hi> Againe, all this is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerued on our parts, for we haue deſerued iuſtly to bee caſt off from God: for wee diſerue nothing but damnation, and when we haue done all wee can doe, yet ſtill <hi>wee are vnprofitable ſeruants,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 17.</note> and therefore, with <hi>Dauid</hi> wee may iuſtly ſay, <hi>not vnto vs Lord, not vnto vs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 115.1. Rom. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>but to thy name giue the praiſe, for thy mercy and truths ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, when wee were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to GOD, yet did he looke vpon vs: all which as it ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauateth our miſery, and Gods mercy, ſo it ſhould aggrauate our hatred to all ſin, and loue to God and goodneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee muſt remember the end of our preſeruation, &amp; that is to leaue vs ſo much the more without
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7860:26"/> excuſe, at the latter day, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not theſe things to make aright vſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to make our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo much the greater, hauing abuſed Gods mercy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that we may be moued by the ſight and conſideration of Gods great mercy, to yeeld him all poſſible thanks and praiſe, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame, by all dutifull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his commandements.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that wee may hereby ſee our owne inabilitie, weakeneſſe and inſufficiencie, how ſoone wee might periſh, were not God our good God, to helpe vs and do for vs.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, to make vs depend vpon his fatherly prouidence, in the vſe of all meanes:<note place="margin">Lam. 3.38.</note> for <hi>out of the mouth of the moſt high, proceedeth both euill and good.</hi> That is, both proſperitie
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7860:26"/> and aduerſitie.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, to make vs humble ſuters to Almighty God, for euery good we ſtand in need of, <hi>If the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had not beene on our ſide, they had then ſwallowed vs vp quick,</hi> for it is only Hee, who preſerues vs, and <hi>euery good and perfect gift comes from aboue.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 1.17.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, to attribute nothing to chance and fortune, but all to Gods mercy in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to deny our ſelues, with all that wee haue, acknowledging that <hi>not for any merit in vs,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe <hi>God had a fauour vnto vs, he hath ſhewed ſuch wonderfull deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance vnto vs both in ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi> for had it not beene Gods end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe mercy, wee had long ſince beene ſwept away, as the Prophet <hi>Eſaiah</hi> hath it:<note place="margin">Eſay. 19:</note> 
                     <hi>Except the Lord of of Hoſts had left vs a ſmall remnant,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7860:27"/> we had long ſince beene like</hi> Sodome <hi>and like</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>for the Lord our God hath not ſet his loue vpon vs, for any thing in vs, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee loued vs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 7.7, 8</note> hath hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, preſerued, and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs, and done all good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</p>
                  <p>Heere wee are briefely to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of theſe things. Firſt how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly God beſtoweth his bleſſings and benefits dayly vpon vs: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally how he continueth the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty of the Goſpell amongſt vs, encreaſing dayly the number of faithfull Preachers: <hi>Who breake vnto vs the bread of life:</hi> this is a bleſſing of bleſſings, without which the ſoule may the ſooner ſtarue; yet indeed of the wicked of the world no more eſteemed of, then their old ſhooes, and therefore they ſeldom heare it, lightly regard it, but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7860:27"/> neuer practiſe it: this is that pearle to attaine which wee ought to ſell all that wee haue, rarher then to want it: if this meditation of the price of this word, were true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our hearts, it would not bee that ſo many could ſuffer their people to ſtarue for want of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let vs remember our health, wealth, peace and liberty, &amp; our dayly protecting vnder ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a gouernment, which wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy by God: <hi>It is in,</hi>

                     <hi>and through him, that we liue, wee moue and haue our being, hee giueth vs life and breath, and all things,</hi> wee cannot liue one minute of an howre, without Gods prouidence: hee dayly prouideth for vs foode and rayment: and no good thing doth he withhold fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs: he defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs day and night from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7860:28"/> 
                     <hi>he maketh men to be of one minde:</hi> and liue together in vnity: he bleſſeth our corne, our cattell, and all our ſubſtance: he proſpereth all our handy worke, our meate might be our bane, did not God continually bleſſe it vnto vs: wee might haue our Throats cut in our beds, were nothe watchful ouer vs, by his fatherly prouidence: he ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth raine to moyſten the earth: <hi>Hee giueth graſſe for the Cattell,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut 11.</note> 
                     <hi>and Hearbs for the vſe of man; he cauſeth the Corne and oyle to come to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that man may eate, and haue all manner of fruit in aboundance, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forſaketh his inheritance, he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth our going out, and comming in,</hi> On foote on horſeback, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and out of company, in publike and ſecret, at home and abroad, ſleeping and waking, hee is all in all vnto vs. This meditation will make
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7860:28"/> vs to receiue nothing without thankeſgiuing, to liue circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to looke to our wayes, and to ſtudy to pleaſe God, to giue our hearts vnto him, and to make him our treaſure.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this ſerues to put vs in mind of all thoſe gracious promiſes that God hath made vnto vs, either of temporall bleſſing; or ſpirituall grace, which we are to beleeue, that in Gods due time they ſhal be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and ſo we ſhal not loſe our reward. The not beleeuing of this truth, is one maine cauſe of ſinne, and the continuance of it: and no one thing doth make the wicked ſo deſperate in euill courſes, as this, to thinke it is altogether in vaine to liue a godly life. <hi>We muſt therefore remember and beleeue that God is a plentifull rewarder of all thoſe that ſeeke him,</hi>

                  <p>Let vs learne then out of this Pſalme, that it is the will of God, to exerciſe his Saints with troubles and afflictions,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.12.</note>

                  <p>This confuteth a damnable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who hold, and reach, That a man elected, called, iuſtified, and ſanctified, may for euer fall away; and bee damned: that he which to day is the deare child of God, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may become the child of the

                  <p>This may ſerue to reproue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of men, who are ready to abuſe this Doctrine. Tuſh, ſayth the carnall and looſe Chriſtian, it skils not how a man liues, whether well or ill: he that is elected, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7860:73"/> is a member of Chriſt, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and he that is reiected, ſhall be damned, though he liue neuer ſo well: Therefore they take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſinne, and make no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any ſinne whatſoeuer. But they muſt know, that God decrees a man as well to the meanes as to the end: and it is impoſſible a man ſhould be elected and called, but he muſt liue well; ſo he that is not elected &amp; called, cannot liue well: And it is all one, as if a man ſhould neuer eate or drinke, and yet hope to liue and like well; or lying in the fire or water, and vſing no meanes to come out, ſhould not periſh. But wee muſt know, that the end and the means muſt goe together; and for a man to neglect or reiect the means, it is in vaine for him to hope to be ſaued: for if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto God, thou ſhalt in time

Here we learne this doctrine that they are bleſſed and happy that do rely vpon Chriſt, and make him their ſtay and refuge: <hi>Bleſſed is the man,</hi> ſayth <hi>Ieremie,</hi>

                  <p>And the reaſon thereof is this, becauſe they ſhall neuer periſh but haue euerlaſting life, as it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times repeated in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: where God the Father is ſaid to haue loued the world ſo, that <hi>hee gaue his onely begotten Son for it,</hi>

                     <hi>that whoſoeuer did beleeue in him ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> For in theſe two things all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe and happines doth ſtand: firſt, in a freedome from all miſery and deſtruction, then in a poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all ioyes and life euerlaſting.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let euery one of vs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſoundly and truely to beleeue in Chriſt, and to depend vpon him, as vpon a ſure rocke that will

A man will doe much to haue happines here in this world, &amp; euery one by nature doth deſire the ſame: and ſhall not we then truſt in Chriſt to attaine vnto it.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7860:78"/> vp our hearts to cleane faſt vnto Chriſt: doubtleſſe there is nothing wanting in him, which is fit to be in one, on whom we are to place our truſt. There are ſixe things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of ſuch a one. Firſt, power, that hee may bee able to helpe vs. Secondly, Will, that hee may bee ready to doe it. Thirdly, Skill, that he may know how to do it. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Remembrance, that may mind vs for the doing of it. Fifthly, Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, that he may not poſt it off or neglect it from time to time. Laſtly, Boldneſſe, that he may feare no inconuenience to enſue vpon it, to hinder him from doing of it: but all theſe are in Chriſt, he is able to helpe vs, becauſe hee is <hi>Omnipotent:</hi> he is <hi>willing,</hi> becauſe he loues vs to the death: he is <hi>Skilfull,</hi> becauſe all the treaſures of knowledge and wiſedome are hid
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7860:78"/> in him: he is <hi>Mindfull,</hi> becauſe his eyes are alwayes open vpon vs, as who doth neirher ſlumber nor ſleepe, but ſtands alwayes girded in the midſt of the ſeuen golden Candleſtickes to doe them good. He is <hi>Carefull,</hi> becauſe he is Lord and King ouer all; and that Lyon of <hi>Iudah</hi> that feareth nothing. Withdraw not then your hearts from him, but truſt in him moſt conſtantly for euermore.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by this we ſee that <hi>godlineſſe is great gaine,</hi> or riches, as the Apoſtle doth ſpeake: for <hi>truſt</hi> here you ſee brings with it <hi>bleſſedneſſe:</hi> it is not a barren thing, but fruitfull it comes laden with all the bleſſings of the Lord vnto vs. Curſed man will ſay,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.14.</note> that <hi>it is in vaine to ſerue the Lord, and that there is no profite in keeping his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> and in walking hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7860:79"/> before him. But here wee are taught the contrary, the wicked that doe rebell, they are caſt downe and doe periſh; but as for thoſe which doe ſerue Chriſt and truſt in him, they ſtand vp and are bleſſed. Then for as much as <hi>your labour is not in vaine in the Lord,</hi> that I may vſe the phraſe of the Apoſtle: <hi>Bee yee ſtedfaſt, vnmoueable, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant alway in the worke of the Lord:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.58.</note> and truſt you in Chriſt for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, which wil thus bring bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto you.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then they are bleſſed that doe truſt in Chriſt, euen then when others periſh and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed wee ſhould not feare at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time, but be of a good hope and comfort in the middeſt of all our calamities, as knowing that then wee are bleſſed and in happy
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7860:79"/> eſtate as well as at other times: for Chriſt doth know how to make a ſeparation betwixt vs that are his friends, and others that are his enemies.</p>
                  <p>Queſtionleſſe, as God did put a difference betwixt the Iſraelites &amp; the Egyptians in all ſuch plagues as hee ſent among them, ſparing ſtill the Iſraelites, and puniſhing the Egyptians, and as he did put a difference betwixt his ſeruant <hi>Noah</hi> and the olde world:<note place="margin">Gen. 7.</note> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Noah,</hi> and drowning the world: and as he did put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt holy <hi>Lot</hi> and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Sodome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note> deliuering <hi>Lot</hi> and burning <hi>Sodome</hi> with fire and brimſtome from heauen, ſo will Chriſt put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs and others to ſaue vs, and deſtroy them, as wee may
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7860:80"/> ſee moſt apparently. Where it is ſayd,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.32.</note> 
                     <hi>that he will gather all nations before him, and that he will ſeparate them one from another, as a Sheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard ſeparates the ſheepe from the Goates:</hi> ſending ſome to hell, and carrying others with him into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Let vs then neuer feare in any perill or danger whatſoeuer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of war, famine, plague, or the like leſt wee ſhould periſh with the wicked hand ouer head: we ſee he hath a care of his own, and what he will doe he can doe: if it be good for vs to eſcape theſe worldly woes we are aſſured wee ſhall, as we are ſure, we liue. And if otherwiſe it pleaſe him to wrap vs with others, in the outward puniſhment, yet ſhall we euer bee ſure to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from them in the eternall payne, and thoſe outward griefes ſhall bee but meanes to leade vs
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7860:80"/> to euerlaſting ioyes.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore ſaith he, like as mount <hi>Sion</hi> or our holy city <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> is neuer moued, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſure and ſafe by the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty protection of the Lord, in all extremities; ſo he that truſteth in the Lord, ſhall be defended againſt the furious rage of the world, and the gates of hell for euer: pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this to bee chiefeſt anchor of our ſaluation, onely to hope and truſt in the Lord,<note place="margin">To hope &amp; and truſt in the Lord is the greateſt ſeruice that we can doe to him.</note> and that is the greateſt ſeruice that wee can doe vnto God: for this is the nature of God as I haue ſayd, to create all things of nothing; therefore hee createth and bringeth forth in death life, in darknes light, &amp; this to beleeue is the very nature and moſt ſpeciall property of faith: when God then ſeeth ſuch a one as agreeth with his owne nature,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7860:81"/> that is, which beleeueth to finde in danger, helpe; in pouerty, riches; in ſinne righteouſneſſe; and that for Gods owne mercies ſake in Ieſus Chriſt alone:<note place="margin">The nature of faith.</note> him can God neither hate nor forſake, for <hi>he worſhippeth God truely which putteth his whole truſt in the mercy of God.</hi> With this ſeruice God is highly pleaſed, becauſe he deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of nothing to make ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo hee made the world of nothing; ſo hee rayſed the dead: who ſo then conſenteth to Gods nature, and obeyeth his will, there hoping for ſomething where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is, he it is that pleaſeth God and ſhall neuer be remoued.</p>
                  <p>That is, they ſhall neuer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from Gods fauour, they ſhall neuer bee remoued from the conſtant graces of the ſpirit in their ſoules, or hurtfully in the way of a

                  <p>Therfore cleaue ye faſt vnto him, and feare not, be of good comfort, though others be curſed, yet you ſhalbe bleſſed, for you ſee the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of being religious and being

                  <p>Firſt, this may ſeeme to reproue that curſed, yet common opinion of the world: namely, that of all men, the godly man is moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. We ſee here the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth proclaime from heauen, that he accounteth the godly man and him that truſts in the Lord, a bleſſed and happy man: but yet the world, that is the wicked men in

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, this may ſerue to ſtop their mouthes that ſay and thinke it is in vaine to ſerue the Lord, that it is loſt labour to bee religious, that there is no good got by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7860:83"/> of Sermons and leading of a godly life: it is, and euer hath beene the curſed thoughts of mans heart to thinke ſo, as in the time of the Prophet <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi>

                     <hi>It is loſt labour to ſerue the Lord, and what good comes there by ſeruing of God:</hi> So in theſe dayes it is cleare, men thinke it is in vayne to bee religious, to liue godly, and in all thinges to labour to keepe fayth and a good conſcience, before God and men. But it is manifeſt here that it is not in vaine to ſerue God: nay it is that alone that bringeth a man to happineſſe and true comfort here, and eternall meaſure of glory in the world to come: &amp; withall this may ſerue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort euery child of God againſt all the diſcouragements of the world by Satan &amp; his curſed inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                  <p>Nay fifthly, ſuppoſe a man were in the houſe of death, in the graue; yet euen this ſeparates not from Gods mercyes, which being eternal leaues vs not in death: but when we are moſt compaſſed with duſt and corruption, ſhall then bee moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant and mightie for vs.</p>

                  <p>Thus wee ſee what conſolations the holy Ghoſt ſetteth forth vnto them which beleeue the word, for vnto ſuch as looke for a better life then this is, all things are here full of calamities and miſeries, <hi>death fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth death,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, and we continually die; one temptation followeth another, vntill at the length, by the death of the fleſh all miſeries ſhall ceaſe and haue an end. This verſe therfore admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, that wee muſt ſuffer many troubles, yet ſo that at length wee ſhall be ſafe, and ſet at libertie from them, although not in this life, yet in the life to come, as this verſe full of conſolation doth promiſe vs. Notwithſtanding this promiſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth incredible, both to vs which ſuffer, and alſo to them which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7860:96"/> and aflict vs, for if wee behold the ſame with our outward eyes, what can be more falſe; yea, the contrary ſeemeth to bee moſt true: behold our Sauiour Chriſt, was hee not ſo forſaken, hanging vpon the Croſſe, that <hi>the rod or ſcepter of the wicked reſted vpon him,</hi> did it not reſt likewiſe vpon the <hi>Prophets,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and orher holy Martyrs: this matter then, if we conſider it with our outward eyes, hath another meaning then the words doe import, for they promiſe that <hi>the Scepter of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhall haue no power ouer the godly,</hi> and yet all Stories and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples doe teſtifie the contrarie; therefore the holy Ghoſt calleth vs backe to the purpoſe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of God reuealed in his word, and commaundeth vs to weigh and conſider, not what we ſuffer,

                  <p>Whereupon we may ground this propoſition out of the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible counſell of God, <hi>God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the wicked, and loueth the iuſt, ergo,</hi> he <hi>will damne and deſtroy the wicked, and will deliuer and ſaue the iuſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And heere we ſee that which is the chiefeſt thing in all Pſalmes and Prophets to ſpring out of the firſt precept. <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now haue we to learne, how wee may apply this verſe right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to our great comfort, for <hi>true diuinitie conſiſteth in vſe and practiſe.</hi> Wee are vexed on euerie ſide with wicked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe ſcorners, and others which hate the word of God, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7860:98"/> which we profeſſe.<note place="margin">Comfort when the godly are not eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the wicked.</note> The men of this world eſteeme Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as the off-ſcowrings of the earth: So <hi>Paul,</hi> a choſen veſſell of God, yet not eſteemed of men. Let this confirme the godly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the contempt of men, onely the Lord hath in his owne hand the ballance of Iuſtice which weigheth men aright, according as they are: but theſe are very tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, if wee compare them with thoſe vexations, which Sathan, ſinne, and our owne infirmitie raiſe vp in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences: we muſt learne therefore thus to iudge of all things, that they are the rod or ſcepter of the wicked, and to ſet the Lord againſt them; reuealing his will here in his word, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing that he will not ſuffer the ſcepter of the wicked to reſt vpon the godly. Since then the ſame
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7860:98"/> Prince promiſeth thus much vnto vs, which hath all things in his hand, what can we require more: for the will of God is certaine, that though he ſuffer vs to be afflicted, yet will he not ſee vs troden vnder foote or periſh.</p>
                  <p>What the rod ſignifieth in the Scriptures, it is well knowne: chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they are young are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected with a rod, and when they waxe bigger, with a wand, or a cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, and if they will not amend, then followeth the iron rod: hereof it commeth that the rod ſignifieth all power and rule, which is for the amendment and corrction of ſuch as doe offend: ſo it is taken in the 110. <hi>Pſalme, The Lord ſhall ſend forth the rod of thy power out of Sion;</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>Thy kingdome,</hi> for here he ſignifieth ſuch a rod where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by kingdomes and people are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7860:99"/> On this wiſe the Holy Ghoſt permitteth heere to the Wicked dominion and tyrannie ouer the Godly, which they are compelled to ſuffer: this domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or tyrannie the Holy Ghoſt called the rodde of the Wicked, and comforteth vs. That as the Lord liueth, their tyrannie ſhall fall, and ſhall not reſt vpon the lot of the Godly.</p>
                  <p>The lot of the Iuſt, is as much to ſay as the Portion, that is, the Number or Congregation of the luſt: like as Chriſt calleth them the <hi>little Flocke,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>poore Saints.</hi> Ouer theſe (ſayth hee) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the tyrants doe rule, yet ſhall not their power endure: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the perſecutors of the Church doe oppreſſe the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet ſhall they not doe ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, neyther ſhall their counſels
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7860:99"/> haue that ſucceſſe which they deſire: for they thinke to roote out this Doctrine for euer; but that ſhall they neuer be able to doe. Therefore, albeit ye ſuffer in the meane time, ſayth the Holy Ghoſt; yet know ye, that my will is, That <hi>they which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in me, ſhall neuer periſh,</hi> but ſhall be preſerued to life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
                  <p>Here then haue ye whereunto ye may truſt in all your tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>But behold the reaſon which the Holy Ghoſt heere vſeth, to proue the Scepter of the Wicked ſhall not reſt vpon the Iuſt: God is moued (ſayth he) to helpe and defend the Iuſt: For elſe it might ſo come to paſſe, that God ſhould haue no Church at all, and the Iuſt ſhould put
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7860:100"/> forth their hands to wickedneſſe. So we finde in <hi>Ieremy,</hi> that before the people were deliuered into the hands of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> they had a promiſe, that after ſeuentie yeares they ſhould returne againe to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> becauſe they ſhould not bee brought into doubt of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſo vtterly diſpaire, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from God, ſhould turne to fooliſhneſſe, (that is to ſay) ſhould blaſpheme and become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, this is the cauſe why God ioyneth the promiſe of the word with the execution and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the deede, for elſe the godly ſhould be driuen to deſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: We ſee how many are caſt downe with aduerſitie, by the loſſe of goods, wife, children, &amp; other things which are deere vnto them, except therefore their minds were raiſed vp againe and comforted;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7860:100"/> firſt with the word and promiſe, and then with the performance and execution of the ſame, many would ſay there were no God: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God muſt needs ſhew himſelfe to be a God, not onely in a word, but alſo in deed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> had great promiſes of God,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 15.30.</note> and yet by his owne ſonne was driuen out of his kingdome, and ſo perſecuted, that hee was compelled to flye away bare head and bare foote, this was a ſore ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, wherefore the great and ample promiſes made vnto him could neuer haue raiſed him vp and comforted him againe, except God had indeede deliuered him out of this great miſerie and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; euen ſo, if we had no more but the promiſes of God to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port vs againſt the Papiſts and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries of the word; yea, if God
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7860:101"/> did not indeede fight for vs, and defend vs againſt their tyranny; God therfore worketh both waies: hee raiſeth vp with the word and promiſe, and deliuereth out of troubles and afflictions by the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the deed, that according to the ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the tentation ſhould not be aboue our ſtrength, but ſhould haue an end: and wee learne by our owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the firſt Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>I am the Lord thy GOD,</hi> is moſt certaine and infailable; therefore when he ſaith, Leaſt the iuſt ſhould turne away from God and fall to gentilitie, for GOD hath a double care ouer the faithfull; firſt that they bee not ouercome, but may ouercome the tentation. And this he doth by the word and promiſe; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, that the tentation bee
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7860:101"/> not perpetuall, euen ſo muſt we be vndoubtedly perſwaded, that beſides the infailable promiſes which we haue of the good will of God towards vs, and in the end of euerlaſting life, wee ſhall alſo be deliuered, and our aduerſaries deſtroyed, albeit wee can ſee no manner of way or poſſible meanes how that it may bee done.</p>
                  <p>But heere wee muſt beware, that wee doe not appoint the time of this deliuerance, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that come, God will haue vs tried to the vttermoſt, and brought to that extremitie, that all our hope and truſt ſhall bee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſpent, and we at the point of deſparation.</p>
                  <p>Now when wee are brought into this caſe, that wee can ſee nothing but deſparation, then,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7860:102"/> euen then God ſendeth comfort: in death he ſheweth life, and euen in damnation he bringeth ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Briefely, of nothing hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all things: and when all hope of remedie is paſt, then beginneth he to worke, and frameth all anew againe in moſt perfect wiſe. Thus cannot the God of this world doe, this is the ſingular worke of God: therefore when thou thinkeſt thy ſelfe cleane caſt away, and vtterly forſaken, euen then thou ſhouldeſt be moſt ſure and ſafe, and moſt gloriouſly ſhine as the Day-ſtarre in the Firmament. Theſe things are eaſily taught: but by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we finde and feele, how farre they paſſe all reaſon and power of man, and how hardly we can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that God maketh all things of nothing; that he is carefull of vs, and for vs, whether we be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7860:102"/> in the fleſh, or in the ſpirit; and that he is more mindfull of our deliuerance, then we our ſelues can be.</p>
                  <p>Here haue wee then a ſingular promiſe and conſolation: as if he ſhould ſay, the rodde of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked grieueth you, but be of good comfort my people, and patiently endure it, for I will not ſuffer the tentation ſo farre to preuayle ouer you, that your confidence and truſt in me ſhall vtterly fayle you: ſtormes and tempeſts ſhall ariſe, and your dangers ſhall ſeeme ſo great, as though the waues ſhould preſently ſwallow you vp; but I will not ſuffer you to periſh: I will bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle their rage, and make an end of the rodde of the wicked. If Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and your owne Conſcience doe accuſe you as moſt wicked and vnrighteous, yet will I not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7860:103"/> leaue you deſtitute of my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus doe Tentations teach vs the true vſe and meaning of the firſt Commandement; the which none without Afflictions and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations ſhall rightly know or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
                  <p>Hereby the Prophet will teach vs, that our Afflictions are but ſhort, and endures but a while: <hi>The rodde of the wicked ſhall not lye for euer vpon the backe of the righteous.</hi> The time of our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in holy Scripture is called ſometime <hi>a Day of Triall,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>an Houre of Tentation.</hi> As our Sauiour ſaid to the three Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.40.</note> 
                     <hi>Can yee not watch with mee one houre?</hi> ſo may he ſay to vs all, as oft as wee faint vnder trouble, Can ye not ſuffer with me one houre? It was the comfort that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7860:103"/> 
                     <hi>Athanaſius</hi> gaue to the Church in his time, that <hi>Iulian</hi> ſhould be but a ſtormie little Cloud, that would quickly paſſe by. And it is certainely true, both of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and of all the inſtruments thereof. Let vs waite a while on our God with patience, and wee ſhall ſee them no more.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſeeing the vſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and ſorrowes of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is but for a time, to exerciſe their faith, and patience, and therefore cannot be perpetuall: for when the tryall is ouer, the burthen muſt bee remooued. The time of Winter is bitter, and barren, and cold, through Froſts, and Stormes: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that it is profitable for the Earth, and Plants, to kill Weedes, and Wormes, and to mellow and rot the Ground;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7860:104"/> it is a forerunner of a pleaſant ſpring and a fruitfull harueſt: ſuch is the ſtate of the godly often here. Chriſt the Sonne of righteouſneſſe ſometimes departs further off, and leaues the beleeuer in a wintrous eſtate, laid open to many ſtormes and ſad ſhowers: but, beſides that all this winter prepares the ſoyle, and kils the weeds and vermine of the ſoule, it goes before an happie ſpring and harueſt, which wil bring in fruits of righteouſneſſe to thoſe that are exerciſed. <hi>I goe away for a while, and ye ſhall be ſorrowfull: but I will come againe, and your heart ſhall reioyce, and your ioy ſhall none take away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is then firſt of all a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ground of patience in ſorowes; <hi>The rod of the wicked ſhall not lye for euer vpon the backe of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi> And ſeeing God hath ſet
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7860:104"/> the time how long they ſhall laſt, and ſhall not exceed the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time. This ſhould alwayes learne vs patience: yea, hee hath not onely ſet a time of durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but alſo of exchanging thy ſorrowes into ioy. Art thou in any trouble, or vnder any moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Satan? Are wicked men vnder reproch, ſcandall, hatred, perſecution, &amp;c? it is a ſtorme too violent to laſt long: nay, it ſhall bee changed into a calme, into a faire and comfortable ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Suppoſe thou bee in the Night of diſgrace, blacked and darkened by wicked ones, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was: Suppoſe thou haue things layd to thy charge, that thou neuer kneweſt, and art for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to repay that which thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tookeſt; yet wait ſtill the good time: after thou haſt endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7860:105"/> a little ſcowring, all the ſoyle will tend to thy brightneſſe; and the time comes, that God will make thy innocencie to breake out as the light.</p>
                  <p>Art thou ſicke in thy Soule, or pained in thy Bodie, and ſeeſt no way but preſent Death? wait the time, and thou ſhalt meete not onely with perfect cure, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health alſo: onely ſee thou makeſt Chriſt thy Phyſician. God had appointed a time of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> tryall for three dayes; but the third day turned his ſorrow into ioy: in which hee had the comfort, both of his ſonne and his owne obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ionas</hi> had his appointed time of ſorrow in the belly of Hell, in the bottome of the Sea, when hee was caſt out of ſight: but at the end of three dayes hee was
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7860:105"/> caſt on the dry ground, and his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and feares were turned into ioy and prayſes.</p>
                  <p>The Theefe on the Croſſe was euen in the hands of death, his paines and ſorrowes encreaſing: as hee felt his life decreaſing, how did our bleſſed Sauiour comfort him, and ſupport him with patience? but with this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that the end was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and a time appointed, which ſhould inſtantly turne that ſhame and ſorrow into glorie and ioy, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Lazarus</hi> was not onely in the hands, but in the Houſe of Death foure dayes: yet a time was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, euen the fourth day, wherein the bands of Death were to be looſed, and hee reſtored to his former life.</p>

                  <p>And thus ſhall it be with all the Diſciples of Chriſt; whoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſhall not laſt alwayes: the longeſt they can laſt, is but for this life: and while they doe laſt, they haue the comfort of both thoſe Petitions of Chriſt; firſt, <hi>That the Father would keepe them in the World;</hi> and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that after they be ſafely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the World, and the troubles and diſgrace of it, <hi>They may be where himſelfe is,</hi>

Secondly, the wicked of the World will ſee they want no tryals or vexation: but on the contrary, God will ſee they ſhall not want ſeaſonable deliuerance; hee will not leaue him in his hand: And although (ſuch is their inbred malice) that they would neuer take off their Rods from the backes of the godly; yet <hi>God will not ſuffer the Rod of the vngodly alway to lye on the lot of the righteous.</hi> Thirdly,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.8.</note> if their owne ſinnes beſet them hard, and ſo diſmay them, as though they ſhould neuer get freedome: And this is the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt band of all, which tyeth them to trouble; and all other troubles were but a play, ſo
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7860:107"/> that the heart were perſwaded of the pardon of Sinne (as the Saints in ſickneſſe of Conſcience can confeſſe.) But <hi>Sinne ſhall ſlay the vngodly.</hi>

                  <p>Moreouer, wee are here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of the great danger that followeth theſe Afflictions and Tentations, which they that through impatience forſake the Word, and Faith, doe fall into. Therefore the Lord here ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe ſo carefull for his people, leſt they ſhould fall into this danger: for their ſtate which haue once forſaken the Word,

                  </p>
                  <p>Wee muſt therefore patiently ſuffer and perſeuere in all Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and rather abide all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, then once ſhrinke from the Word of Life, leſt wee bee poſſeſſed with ſeuen Spirits more wicked then the firſt.

                     <hi>In many things wee ſinne all, and the iuſt Man falls ſeuen times a day:</hi>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:7860:118"/> but if thou canſt truely ſay, it is againſt thy purpoſe, I hate the ſinne I commit, I condemne it. I had no purpoſe to doe it, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was to pleaſe God: then thou mayeſt haue comfort, thy heart is ſound, God will not condemne thee for it, <hi>The Lord will ſpare his children, as a father his onely ſonne.</hi> A child is going to Schoole, and his purpoſe is ſo to doe; in the way he falls into ſome companie, and ſtayes there too long, and playes the truant, but it is againſt his purpoſe: euen ſo the child of God purpoſeth to ſerue God, and to pleaſe him in all things, and hath no purpoſe to ſinne; but by ſome temptation of the Diuell, or allurements of the World, hee is ouertaken: <hi>I doe the euill I would not, I cannot doe the good I would, hut I delight in the Law of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7860:118"/> the Lord concerning the inner Man.</hi> This is <hi>Pauls</hi> comfort, and this is the comfort of all Gods children: if they can truely ſay, <hi>I doe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill I would not, I delight in the Law of God;</hi> that God will accept the will for the deed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let this be thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: A priſoner that hath eſcaped out of Priſon, would fayne goe twentie miles in one houre; but by reaſon of his Bolts and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he cannot goe one mile. It is thus with Gods children: Here they would faine eſcape from the priſon of ſinne, and ſhake off the Fetters of vngodlineſſe, that hang on ſo faſt;<note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note> but ſo long as the Fetters are on, and they clothed with the garment of the fleſh, there will corruption leake out of them. It is Gods great mercie vnto the godly, that they haue
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7860:119"/> freedome of Spirit, that their Soules are at libertie, and that they can ſigh and grone, and deſire to be eaſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.4. Our perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this life is rather in deſires, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in deeds. Satisfaction ſhall follow deſires, and God ſhall giue vs more then we deſired. Mat 5.6.</note>Our perfection in this life, is rather in godly deſires, then in a full obtayning of things deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: yet haue the godly this comfort, that where deſires goe before, ſatisfaction ſhall follow; for the Lord hath promiſed to fulfill the deſires of them that feare him: <hi>Bleſſed are they who hunger and thirſt for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for they ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> Yea, ſure it is, how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer our deſires bee, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſire ſo much as the Lord hath to giue vs: for <hi>hee is rich in mercie, able to doe abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, aboue all that wee can aske or thinke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Example hereof wee haue in

                  </p>
                  <p>So ſhall the Lord doe to all his Children; hee ſhall giue them more then eyther they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired or looked for at his hands: <hi>For the heart of man cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe things which God hath prepared for them that loue him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh the riches of Gods vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercie!

                  <p>As for ſuch as turne backe vnto their owne wickedneſſe, the Lord ſhall leade them forth with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill doers: but <hi>peace ſhall be vpon Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> There hath beene of this ſort of men euer ſince the Apoſtles time which hath corrupted the Church, and with a ſhew of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe deceiued the ſimple, which becauſe God puniſheth them not
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7860:121"/> but ſpareth them, and ſuffereth them to proſper in this world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo proud, that they will be counted amongſt the holieſt, and of the world are ſo commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Wee ſee, that not onely the godly are mixed with the wicked in this world, but in the Lords floore alſo the wheat lyeth hidden vnder the chaffe. Wee muſt pray therefore, that God would bring theſe Hypocrites to light, and giue vnto them their iuſt puniſhment, with the workers of iniquitie; then ſhall peace enſue to the Church of God: for whiles the Lord powreth forth his iuſt vengeance vpon the wicked, which vex and perſecute his true members, he gathereth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the good and vpright of heart, and openly declareth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly good will and tender loue towards them.</p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:7860:121"/>
                  <p>This doctrine ſerues to let many men ſee their folly: they hope to be ſaued, and make full account when they die, to goe to God: but yet ſhall neuer come there, becauſe they are not in the wayes of God. If a man ſhould ſay he would goe from Yorke to London, &amp; yet ſhall hold the direct way to Barwicke, would not euery man laugh at him? ſo is it with him that walkes in the path of perdition, and yet ſaith he will come to Heauen. Aske them what way they walke in, and they muſt needs giue themſelues the lye, if they ſay it is Gods way. And in this conceit, thouſands are deceiued, and ſlip into their place before they would, or be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Many by-wayes bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> ſome walke in the blind way of Ignorance, a darke and vncomfortable Way, as Men
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7860:122"/> walking in the night, in which is no ſafetie nor direction: numbers care not for the Lanthorne of the Word, and walking in the night, know not whither they goe, nor where they ſhall lodge. Aske Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts what way they are in? Oh, they are in the way of Catholikes, in the way wherein the Martyrs and Confeſſors died, in the way of their Fore-fathers, what way ſoeuer it be. And I would this Ignorance were among them onely: but (alas) it is the way of too many, who profeſſe the Light.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſome walke in the croſſe wayes of Superſtition, and mens Deuices, as many of our people; who thinke Common prayers better in Lent then all the yeere after: and ſome can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout on high dayes, and come to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7860:122"/> Church; but other dayes Gods Seruice is not ſo effected. And ſome receiue the Sacrament at Eaſter, and they were damned if they did not: but all the yeere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Sacrament hath no ſweetneſſe. Theſe are ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wayes; whereas Gods wayes are the ſame, and to be walked in with the ſame affection.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſome goe in the croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wayes of Humane Reaſon, Will, Policie, and Affections, and cannot yeeld to the Wiſdome of God: their owne Luſts are their Lawes; who ſhould controll them? Here is an infinite number of Rodes, all of them full of wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers from God: whereas Gods way is but one, and of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing, cleane contrary to mans corrupt Reaſon, Will, Affections, and Conuerſation.</p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:7860:123"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, ſome goe in the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and damnable wayes of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpurning againſt the truth:<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall follow their damnable wayes, by whom the way of truth ſhall be euill ſpoken of.</hi> Is it not damnable ynough for men to walke on in the wayes of damnation themſelues, vnleſſe they rayle at the way of truth and life?</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, ſome walke in the filthie myrie wayes of voluptuouſneſſe &amp; profaneneſſe, as foule Fornicators, Drunkards, Gameſters, Gluttons, Epicures, daintie and delicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who ſeeme to be made for nothing but idlenes, &amp; effeminate care of their skin, &amp; fruition of their owne ſenſuality &amp; appetite: to ſuch <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh in the perſon of the yong man, <hi>Walke in the ſight of thine eyes, and in the luſts of thine heart, but know that for all this thou muſt come to Iudgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:7860:123"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, numbers walke in the rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſtonie, thornie, and clayie wayes of Earthlineſſe, Couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Vſurie, and Oppreſſion, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues faſt in the gall and guile of earthly-mindedneſſe, not hauing power ouer themſelues to ſtirre hand or foot to Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: <hi>Where their Treaſure is, there haue they locked vp their hearts too;</hi> or rather burying them (for ſo they may, being dead) in the earth and earthly deſires: the Heauen that they wiſh for, they haue; what then care they for any way that leads to another?</p>
                  <p>Firſt wee learne hence, that in our Chriſtian conuerſation there ſhould be a continuall progreſſe in godlineſſe. <hi>For as in walking</hi> (ſaith <hi>Baſil) the ſteppes of the feet by a mutuall ſtrife among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are changed, in ſuch ſort,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7860:124"/> that the foot which now is hindmoſt, is formoſt next, continuing alway this motion, till we come to the place of our reſt: ſo ſhould there be in the Chriſtian ſuch a continuall promoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his heart toward God, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> affection which this day is behind, coldeſt in the loue of God, ſloweſt to obey him, ſhould the next day be made formoſt:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bern.</note> 
                     <hi>For in this life no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtandeth in one ſtate; it is moſt certaine, that hee that goes not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, goes backward.</hi> Yet I would not ſo be vnderſtood, as if the Chriſtian had not his owne fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and falling in the way of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe: yet bleſſed be God, who keepes our Soules in life; wee ſo faint, that wee reviue; we ſo fall, that wee riſe againe: of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Follies, wee learne to bee wiſe; of the experience of our weakeneſſe, wee gather ſtrength:
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7860:124"/> we walke then more warily, becauſe ſo oft we haue ſtumbled and fallen: of our ſinnes we make vantage: he who is truly penitent walkes alway in ſorrow and feare, becauſe hee hath fallen ſo oft in feare, leaſt hee ſhould fall againe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">What to be done in our fals.</note> let vs be circumſpect both to preuent and recouer our ſelues out of our fals in this way, by reaſon of Sathans fierce temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the weakneſſe of grace, &amp; the frailtie of the fleſh. Many are the fals and knocks of the beſt:<note place="margin">Pſal 19.12.</note> 
                     <hi>In many things we ſinne all,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Iames,</hi> and who knoweth his errors: Now if we will preuent theſe, we muſt beware of occaſions of ſinne, as a traueller ſteps ouer ſtones &amp; rubs in his way. <hi>Eue</hi> preuented not the occaſion of her fall when ſhee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred talke with the Serpent. Wee muſt make a couenant with our
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7860:125"/> eies, not to looke vpon a Woman, nor on the wine in a cup. We muſt watch ouer our ſelues, both alone and in company, and not run into bad company, leaſt we come home by weeping croſſe, as <hi>Peter</hi> did. Secondly, we muſt not lye in our fals: a man in his iourney, if hee fall and lye ſtill, ſhall neuer come to his wayes end: and if hee riſe quickly, though it hinder him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it ſhall not bee much. The Saints all of them recouered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues out of their fals, by renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Faith and Repentance. A man out of his way muſt come backe againe: the ſooner he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes the leſſe is his labour: <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> preſently went out and wept bitterly, and ſo was reſtored to Chriſts fauour.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe thy fals be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, and often into the ſame ſins, yet
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7860:125"/> let them not hinder thee ſtill out of the way. For as the Childe of GOD muſt neither preſume nor purpoſe ſinne: ſo muſt he not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of riſing, hauing fallen into ſinne, ſeeing the promiſe is; that <hi>If a mans ſinnes,</hi> for hainouſneſſe, <hi>be as red as ſcarlet,</hi> vpon his true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>they ſhall bee made white as Snow:</hi> And the parable teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>if a ſinner offendeth ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times ſeuen times in a day, and as often truly repent, he ſhall be as oft forgiuen.</hi> Fourthly, after ſuch falls, we muſt be more warie and careful, leaſt we fall in the ſame manner. A man, yea, a beaſt will be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when it comes by the ſame place where it caught a fall: yee cannot get it into the ſame hole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>Dauid</hi> no doubt, would not count the Tribes againe, after that fall in numbring them.</p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:7860:126"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, hold on in this way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly with perſeuerance: for the end of a worke crowneth it, and the end of a way gladdeth and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wearie traueller: and this reſt is without end. Many ſet forth on this way, but are diſcouraged by the hardneſſe of the entrance: whereas if they were a little entred, the way would be pleaſant, and the yoake of Chriſt eaſie and ſweete. Others haue gone yet further, but at length looke backe; yea, goe backe, when a man would haue thought they had eſcaped the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of the world: and theſe haue loſt a great deale of labour and comfort. Others, yet farther then they, as the bad earth, euen ſo farre as a man could perceiue no difference betweene them and ſound Chriſtians: and apparent difference was there none but in
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:7860:126"/> perſeuerance, and yet wanting ſoundneſſe, haue ſuffered ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke euen at the hauen, and ſo their former righteouſneſſe is all forgotten: a great deale of way they had gone, and much worke had they rid, whereof they ſhall neuer ſee crowne nor comfort. Oh beware of wearineſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe! As towards the end of his way the traueller is moſt cheerefull: ſo ſhould we, and the rather; becauſe, firſt, euery one affects a good end, euen <hi>Balaam:</hi> and will we not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a little difficultie for it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, ſeeing there are a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that deceiue themſelues about their eſtate in which they are: thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that their waies are right, when God knowes, they are the pathes that leade to hell: they boaſt of their ſuppoſed good, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is nothing but a meere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7860:127"/> of the Diuell to blinde the eyes of their minds, to make them ſeeme that which they are not: they boaſt and bragge of Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet liue without Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: Such people are out of the way, and all this while they doe nothing elſe but deceiue their owne ſoules: for he that is Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is alſo Sanctified: and after Iuſtification, there will follow San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. Wouldſt thou then know, whether thou haſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually remembred thy fals, and art conuerted, and that God hath Iuſtified thee, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning and forgiuing thee all thy ſinnes, and acquitting thee from the guilt and puniſhment of thy ſinnes, and that God accepts thee through Chriſt as righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and that thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be condemned for thy ſinne:
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7860:127"/> then examine thy Sanctification: Doeſt thou leaue thine waies, and walke in the waies of GOD? Doeſt thou vſe all good meanes to come to ſaluation, and auoide all occaſions which might draw thee to deſtruction?</p>
                  <p>In a word, doeſt thou deny thy ſelfe, and wholy reſigne vp thy ſelfe to bee guided by Gods Spirit in all things? then thou art Sanctified, and ſo maiſt approoue thou art Iuſtified, elſe not.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Now there is no condemnation to thoſe which are in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> There is Iuſtification; who are ſuch as walke not after the fleſh,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.10.</note> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit: there is Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. It is the end of our new Creation and ſecond birth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 125.5.</note> which God hath ordained, viz. to walke in good works.</p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:7860:128"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, in a word, vtterly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all ſinne, to hate, loath, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and abhorre it: ſo as to haue nothing to doe any more with it, but to vow and reſolue againſt it; and ſo leaue it and forſake it, and daily more and more to be out of loue with it and our ſelues for it, is a moſt true ſigne of him that hath rightly ſearched himſelfe, and is truly conuerted:<note place="margin">Pro. 28.13.</note> and ſuch a man ſhall obtaine mercy at Gods hand in this world, and euerlaſting mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the world to come. <hi>Wherefore ſeeing we haue theſe promiſes,</hi>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7860:128"/> and to labour for the feare of God, without which wee are impudent and bold in committing of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneneſſe, which wee would not dare to attempt, if the feare of God were firmely ſetled in our hearts: teaching vs alſo, not to make a ſhew of holines for a time, but to goe on conſtantly, and to finiſh our Sanctification, dayly proceeding in a holy courſe: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more holineſſe ſtill to more: that ſo holding out vnto the end, we may receiue the end of our Faith, the ſaluation of our ſoules. <hi>For he that continueth vnto the end,</hi>

                  <p>This people was in bondage vnder the Law, and by the Law vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Captiuitie of Death and Sinne. Now if this people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of their Captiuitie, and ſigh for their deliuerance, what ſhall we thinke of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which liued in Idolatrie, and in their owne luſts, without any Law, &amp; without God,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:7860:131"/> he could not therefore haue ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a more generall, and more grieuous captiuitie, then when he ſaith; That his owne people of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> did long for this deliuerance, which in outward appearance, was moſt holy, and vnder <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> did mightily flouriſh. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how liuely he ſetteth forth that ioy which ſhould follow this deliuerance: we ſhalbe (ſaith he) like them that dreame. By this kind of ſpeech he expreſſeth the greatneſſe of their ioy; meaning that this ioy and gladneſſe ſhould be ſo great, that the heart of man ſhould not be able to conceiue it: as if hee ſhould ſay, when he ſhall heare of. Yea, when we ſhall indeed feele and inioy this deliuerance from ſinne and death, ſo farre paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all that we could hope or look for, the ioy therof ſhall be ſo great,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7860:131"/> that it ſhall ſeeme to vs but as a dreame. For ſo wee ſee it come to paſſe alſo, euen in particular deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerances, when God ſuddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth his Seruants out of any great trouble or affliction:<note place="margin">Acts 12.7.</note> So it happened to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was deliuered by the Angell out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

                     <note place="margin">Gen. 45.19</note> 
                     <hi>and ruleth ouer all the land of Egypt.</hi> He was as one raiſed out of a dreame, and could not beleeue it vntill that it was ſhewed vnto him by certaine tokens to be true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.</p>
                  <p>Heere then is ſet foorth vnto vs, the ineſtimable grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are redeemed through the blood of the Sonne of God: who did not ſpare himſelfe and his owne life, that hee might ſet vs free from the power of the Deuill,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7860:132"/> the wrath of GOD, Death and eternall Damnation; but mans heart is not able, as is ſaid, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend theſe things. The more feeling and taſte he hath thereof, the greater alacritie and courage hath he to goe through all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: the leſſe feeling he hath, the more he is ſhaken with terrours, and at the length looking backe to <hi>Egypt</hi> with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſeeking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpes.</p>
                  <p>Our heart therefore muſt who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt in this Redemption, and wee muſt labour to haue ſome part of this taſte and feeling, which the Prophet rightly compareth to a moſt ioyfull and pleaſant Dreame.</p>
                  <p>We ſee heere the <hi>Iewes</hi> were ſo glad of their deliuerance out of the Babyloniſh Captiuity, and their returne thence, that they
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7860:132"/> ſcarce could beleeue whether it was not a Dreame. Our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie was farre greater; being vnder the Curſe of the Law, ſold vnder Sinne, Bondſlaues vnto Sathan, and Sonnes of Wrath: Which Bondage could wee rightly acknowledge, our Deliuerance would be farre more gratefull then it is. Our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerer was not <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi> nor <hi>Zerubbabel;</hi> but the Sonne of God: of whom they were Types, both in the firſt Induction of that People out of Egypt, into that Land; and in their ſecond Reduction backe againe. He, by putting himſelfe into the Priſon of our Fleſh, and in that Fleſh, by ſuffering that execrable Death, and all the Sorrowes of it; freed vs from the guilt of Sinne, appeaſed
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7860:133"/> the wrath of God, aboliſhed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Death, and deſtroyed the Deuils Kingdome. Now, the Sonne thus freeing vs, wee are free indeed. Oh, the greatneſſe of this deliuerance ſhould aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh vs, whereby we auoid thoſe great and inſuperable euils, which otherwiſe had for euer oppreſſed vs.</p>
                  <p>This ſerueth to comfort all Gods Saints, and all the Elect, who can find this, that they are redeemed; a comfort of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: for what can comfort the Heart of Man more, then to thinke of that glorious Victorie in Chriſt Ieſus? that whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were in the ſtate of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, now they are reſtored into the ſtate of ſaluation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before the Deuill held them bound, hand and foot, in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7860:133"/> and in ſlauiſh thraldome, yet now the Snare is broken, and they are deliuered.

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:7860:140"/> their new eſtate, and makes them to conſider of it ſeriouſly, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a notable means againſt ſinne, ſaying,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.8, 9, 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Yee were once darkeneſſe, but now are light in the Lord, walke as children of the Light, approouing what is pleaſing to the Lord, and haue no fellowſhip with vnfruitfull workes of darkeneſſe, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue them.</hi> It is a manifeſt note of one redeemed,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.2.</note>

And ſurely, if this loue of Chriſt were truly remembred, it could not be that we ſhould ſinne ſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt him, and ſo cruelly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle him by our ſinnes, euen by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying him afreſh againe, as wee doe.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, this Meditation, as it is a notable meanes to preſerue vs from all ſinne; ſo eſpecially it kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vs from theſe, and ſtirreth vs vp to the practiſe of the contrary vertues.

                  <p>Secondly, this Meditation will keepe vs from fainting vnder the Croſſe, and make vs conſtant to vndergoe affliction, and without this we cannot doe either. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

But they that haue a fleſhie heart, (that is to ſay) a ſoft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hart, may not be killed with the Law, but reuiued &amp; raiſed vp with another kind of Doctrine, which the holy Ghoſt calleth here laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ioy, that is to ſay, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7860:144"/> wrath of God againſt ſinne, and the terrors of Gods Iudgements, but to the weake and broken hearted, the ſweete comforts of the Goſpel, that they that are ſecure and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, may now learne to feare the Lord, and they that are to much oppreſſed with feare, may bee of good comfort, and now begin to truſt in the Lord. This difference betweene the Law and the Goſpell is well knowne, but by experience and practiſe it is not ſo wel known: for our infirmitie is ſuch, that we are rather touched with the ſence of Sinne and Death, then with laughter and ioy; that is, the ſweet comforts and ioyfull promiſes of Goſpell.</p>

                  <p>Conſider now the Kingdome of the Pope, and the horrible abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations thereof: in the which there was nothing heard, ſeene, taught, read, or exerciſed, but mens Traditions, mens Dreames, which of their owne nature can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but diſcomfort and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the Conſcience: for one Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition bringeth forth another, one obſeruation followeth another; and that worſt of all is, they are not onely burthens to the Body, but are now become Snares to the Conſcience. Wherefore there was not one iot of this Doctrine in the Popes Kingdome, that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred any occaſion of ioy or glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the poore Conſcience. Great cauſe haue we therefore to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:7860:151"/> be thankefull vnto God for this ineſtimable benefit, that wee now know the Doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to be the Doctrine of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and Saluation: through the which Doctrine, looke how much Ioy thou feeleſt in thy heart, ſo much thou doeſt enioy of Life, and Saluation. But if thou feele thy heart ſtill oppreſſed with heauineſſe, the Deuill hath not yet giuen ouer to vex thee. Wherefore thou muſt haue thy heart well inſtructed in the true vſe of the Law, and of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as wee haue ſaid before; that thou mayeſt know, that the Law ought to be vſed onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the obſtinate, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, and that therein conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the true and proper vſe of the Law.</p>
                  <p>But when it vexeth and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:7860:151"/> ſuch tender Conſciences as are too much feared alreadie, it is not rightly vſed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore terrified Conſciences may in no caſe hearken vnto the Law: for to ſuch pertayneth Laughter and Ioy; the preaching (I ſay) of the Goſpell, or remiſſion of Sinnes, giuen vnto vs in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>And to this effect wee muſt beware of the ſubtill ſleights of Sathan: who, to the end that hee may ſpoyle vs of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Trouble, endeuours by all meanes eyther to quench the Light of God vtterly in our mindes, or at leaſt to darken and obſcure it, by precipitation of our vnbeleeuing hearts.

                  <p>This is it which I touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that this benefit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, this ineſtimable gift of our Redemption, and Life euerlaſting is eaſie to be vttered with words, but moſt hard to be beleeued with the heart: For wee haue in this life not the Tenths,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.23.</note> but <hi>the firſt fruits of the Spirit:</hi> but the fleſh liueth fully and wholly in a manner ſtrong and luſtie.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that wee haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred one foot into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and haue thereby obtayned the aſſurance of the <hi>Promiſe:</hi>

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7860:154"/> continually encreaſe and goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the knowledge of Grace and of Faith. And for this cauſe the Prophet <hi>Zacharie</hi> ſayth, That <hi>the Spirit of Prayer is powred forth vpon vs:</hi> which Spirit requireth this encreaſe in vs. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.22.</note> That <hi>the Spirit ſigheth with ſighes that cannot be expreſſed;</hi> yea, and that <hi>euery creature alſo groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for the deliuerance of the Children of God.</hi> Wherefore, whileſt wee are in this Body, which preſſeth vs downe as a heauie Burthen, and hindereth vs, that wee cannot fully appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend theſe things; wee haue not onely the Spirit of Grace, but the Spirit of Prayer alſo, that we might be aſſured of the grace and good will of God towards vs for Chriſts ſake, in whom we beleeue; and yet ſhould not

Such is the life of Chriſtians which haue already receiued the firſt fruits of the Spirit: who by experience doe learne, that theſe things cannot be fully apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but that in the meane while they ſhall oftentimes ſlip, yea, and ſometimes dangerouſly fall; ſo that the ſparke of Faith, and of the Spirit, may ſeeme in them to be vtterly quenched. As it

Sam. 11.</note> wherein they haue need of helpe to rayſe them vp againe: as Chriſt anſwered to <hi>Paul, My power is made perfect in infirmitie.</hi> The infirmitie is theirs, and remayneth theirs, whileſt they liue; but the power and ſtrength is Chriſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: one dramme of the grace of Chriſt, in the ſoule of a Chriſtian, makes him more precious in the eyes of God, then any remnant-corruption in him can make him odious: Therefore is it, that the Lord giues vnto them the Names of his <hi>Beloued,</hi> his <hi>Seruants,</hi> his <hi>Sonnes,</hi> his <hi>Saints,</hi> who are ſo onely in part. Both theſe are true: <hi>Thoſe that are borne of God, ſinneth not;</hi> and againe, <hi>If wee ſay wee haue no ſinne, wee deceiue our ſelues:</hi> the one wee haue of the fruits of the New Man, the other of the remnants of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7860:155"/> the Old Man. Let vs therefore be continually diſpleaſed with our inhabitant Corruption, that wee deſpaire not, nor be diſcouraged: neither let vs ſo complaine of our Sinnes, that we become falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt the grace of God which is in vs. If there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vs but that we haue by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, our ſtate were moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but ſeeing beſides nature, there is in vs a new workemanſhip of grace, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the Lord accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vs new and ſpirituall men, we haue (God be thanked) matter of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort.</p>
                  <p>Let vs yet further conſider,<note place="margin">This teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the Spirit is not alwayes perceiued in a like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of them that haue it.</note> that this teſtimonie of the Spirit is not all times enioyed in a like meaſure; for that were to enioy Heauen vpon Earth. The Lord doth therfore in ſuch ſort ſuſpence it, that ſometimes he lets his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren feele it for their conſolation,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7860:156"/> and againe withdrawes it from them, for their humiliation. When they feele it, they ſo abound in ioy, that all the terror and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Sathan, all his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and allurements are deſpiſed of them, and trodden vnder their feet: they ſing within themſelues that glorious Triumph of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note> 
                     <hi>Who ſhall ſeperate vs from the loue of God?</hi> But this ioy proceeding from the fulneſſe of Faith, continueth not: the voyce of the Spirit of Adoption wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat more ſilent, feares and doubts ſucceeds in that ſame heart, which before abounded in ioy. And if hereby the weake Conſcience be caſt downe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the more thou art diſpleaſed with thy ſelfe, the more thy Lord is pleaſed with thee: for thy dayly pollutions hee hath
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:7860:156"/> appointed daily waſhings, in that fountaine which he hath opened to the houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> for ſinne and for vncleanneſſe: ſweepe out thy ſinnes euery day, by the beeſome of holy anger and reuenge,<note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> and water the houſe of thy heart with the teares of contrition: ſeeing we cannot be without ſome wounds of Conſcience, let vs daily goe to the next remedie, that with ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all medicines wee may cure them, <hi>Chaſtiſing our ſelues euery morning, and examining our ſelues vpon our bed in the euening.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The firſt fruits of our heart and tongue eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning ſhould be offered to God.</note> And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (O man) that thou oweſt euery day the firſt fruits of thy heart and tongue to the Lord our God: ſhouldſt thou thinke of any thing, before that firſt thou remember him in the morning, or ſhould thy tongue ſpeake of any thing before the firſt fruits of thy ſpeech be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:7860:157"/> vnto him by Prayer, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his holy Name.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee the great neceſſitie of prayſe, and how it ought to be continually vſed among the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if not with the mouth, yet with the heart, and heartie ſighes vnto God, according to the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Colo. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Let the word of God dwell in you plentiouſly:</hi> Signifying, that they ought to be continually exerciſed therein: not onely by teaching the ſame to others publikely and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly, but alſo by earneſt Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Prayer, when they ſit at home in their houſes, when they walke by the way, when they lye downe, and when they riſe, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> teacheth:<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:7860:157"/> and carrying this treaſure in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then veſſels, in the which our faith is as a tender plant, which becauſe it is not yet come to perfect ſtrength, may be eaſily ſhaken with winds &amp; tempeſts. We muſt watch therfore and pray as Chriſt commaundeth, that in our daily conflicts we may ſtand ſtedfaſtly againſt the darts of Sathan, which would driue vs to the contempt of God and man.</p>
                  <p>So doe I vnderſtand this Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not in the perſon of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, as though he prayed for the Reuelation of the Redemption that ſhould come, but in the perſon of the faithfull which haue need con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to pray. The ſence and meaning then hereof is: Lord turne againe our Captiuitie, that is, redeeme vs, which haue begun to be the New creature, that is, our redemption by Chriſt is fully
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:7860:158"/> and perfectly wrought: ſo we may fully and perfectly apprehend, and feele the ſame. For there bee many things which in this life fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this redemption; wherefore it is neceſſarie, that we ſhould bee well armed againſt them, that wee fall not againe into captiuitie. On this wiſe wee muſt alwaies pray, that the firſt fruits of the Spirit, may continually increaſe in vs, and that we may bee redeemed day by day, vntill the Old man be wholly put away by death, then ſhall our Captiuitie bee perfectly changed, euen as the riuers or waters in the South, which by the mighty worke of God were dried vp, and vtterly conſumed. Whether ye vnderſtand heere the red Sea, or elſe the riuer of <hi>Iordan,</hi> it forceth little, the ſimilitude is this; <hi>Like as the waters were dryed vp and conſumed, ſo dry
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:7860:158"/> vp O Lord, and bring to nothing all our Captiuitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How neceſſary the Spirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is, they that haue not fought with Sathan doe not know, but let vs giue our ſelues wholy to the continuall exerciſe of Prayer and Meditation of the holy Scriptures, as it is required in <hi>Luke</hi> 21. <hi>Watch and pray continually.</hi> And againe, <hi>Pray continually:</hi> for example,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.17.</note> at midnight, morning, and at noone-tide did <hi>Dauid</hi> pray. Yea ſeauen times in the day, all the night long did our Sauiour pray, not ſtanding himſelfe in neede of the helpe of Prayer, but ſetting downe to thee an example of Prayer for imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: when he prayed for thee, hee prayed all night long,<note place="margin">Ambroſe.

Let vs then neuer ariſe in the morning, or goe to bed, but as duly let vs euer be mindfull of this dutie, let vs not miſpend our precious time, let vs (I pray you) conſider why we liue heere in the world: not to ſpend and conſume our time in toyes &amp; vanities, but to ſerue God, and to ſeeke for comfort and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto our owne ſoules. Let vs therefore ſo ſpend it, as wee may haue comfort in the end.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith in the 119.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How the time of the day ſhould be ſpent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dauids example.</note>Let vs therefore learne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> how he vſed his time: when hee lay downe at night, hee watred his couch with teares, after the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his heart.

                     <hi>Ye ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſorrow, but your ſorrow ſhall be turned into ioy.</hi> It had beene a great comfort, if Chriſt had onely promiſed, that their ſorrow ſhould be mitigated; and more, to haue ſaid it ſhould be ſhortly ended: but to ſay it ſhall be turned into ioy,<note place="margin">Comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſcorne the godly for ſighing and teares</note> miniſtreth abundant conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtrength in the patient expecting of ſo happie a change.</p>
                  <p>And here, becauſe the prophane World makes a ſcorne of the contrite diſpoſition of the godly,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:7860:177"/> laughing at their teares, taunting them in their ſighes and ſobs; let vs looke here to <hi>Dauid:</hi> if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alway be an argument to moue men to godlineſſe, yet is it forcible to moue God to mercy. The bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart, for the griefe of Sinne, and loue of Righteouſneſſe, how euer the World deſpiſe it, the Lord will not deſpiſe it: yea, it is the Sacrifice of God, acceptable to him in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then, that <hi>all they which will liue godly in Chriſt Ieſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution;</hi> wee muſt hold faſt this Conſolation, whereby we may, as it were, ſeaſon theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; namely, that the Holy-Ghoſt doth here propheſie, That wee muſt <hi>ſowe in teares:</hi> but bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs be of good comfort not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding; for the more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and bitter the teares be, the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:7860:177"/> greater laughter and ioy ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Like as he ſetteth forth alſo a contrary example: <hi>The World ſoweth in laughter, but afterwards it reapeth in euerlaſting ſorrow, anguiſh, and miſerie.</hi> But our Tentations and Afflictions doe here endure but for a little time: Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore patiently ſuffer; in hope, that in ſtead of this painefull ſowing for ſo ſmall a time, wee ſhall hereafter reape euerlaſting ioy, and bleſſedneſſe. And this alſo bringeth great Conſolation, That albeit our whole Life be full of Sorrow, bitter Afflictions, and ſowing altogether in Teares; yet God will ſuffer no Tentations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to continue: but like as Stormes and Tempeſts haue their Seaſons, and afterwards commeth faire Weather, as alſo after Labour followeth Reſt and Quietneſſe;
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7860:178"/> euen ſo experience doth teach vs, that when our hearts haue beene vexed and oppreſſed with cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Deſparation, Miſtruſt, Impatience, before God and the World, for a day, two, or three, or elſe longer; God rayſeth them vp againe with ſome Spirituall comfort: therefore our afflictions are tempered with ſome conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that we ſhould know, that God will not ſuffer vs to be altogether ſwallowed vp with ſorrow. <hi>He will correct vs</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt ſayth) <hi>but will not giue vs ouer vntill death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let vs learne therefore to know theſe things; and that we muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Afflictions, and ſowe in Teares: leſt when Tentation commeth, we be offended, as though ſome new or ſtrange thing were happened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and ſo flye from God, and fall
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:7860:178"/> to diſpaire: and let vs hold faſt this conſolation, that our Harueſt is in Heauen, euen Life euerlaſting, which we ſhall reape with ioy. As the Wine fayled in that Banquet whereat Chriſt was preſent; ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes fayleth ioy euen in the heart where Chriſt dwelleth: but as in the one he turned Water into Wine; ſo in the other will hee turne all ſorrow into ioy. To haue ioy without griefe, is the condition of them who are glorified in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: to haue griefe without ioy, is the condition of them who are damned in Hell; I meane, to bee without ſence and hope of ioy: but the godly on earth haue their ioy mixed with griefe, and griefe tempered with ioy; and albeit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they want the ſence of ioy, yet doe they neuer want all hope and expectation of ioy.</p>

As for the firſt: amongſt many wayes whereby the ſinnes of other men become ours,<note place="margin">If wee mourne not for other mens ſinnes, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ours. 1. Cor. 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> this is alſo one; if we know their iniquities, and bee not grieued therewith. And therefore are the Corinthians reproued, that they ſorrowed not for the inceſtuous man that was among them: by ſo doing, they were defiled by his ſinne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one polluted Lumpe with him.<note place="margin">Ezek. 9. all the chapter.</note> And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> not onely in Iudgement determined vpon the committers of ſinne, but of ſuch alſo as mourned not for ſinne: They are inuolued in the ſame

                  <p>And as for the great good wee get by mourning for the ſinnes of the Wicked,<note place="margin">If wee mourne, many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings follow it.

And this is done, when a ſinner powres the teares of his penitent Heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Boſome of God: Then the Heauens are vvatered by the Earth. For the teares of the godly fall not to the ground, but the Lord gathereth them,

                  <p>Therefore walke on in this way: for it is not a way that can bring a man to any deſired place, but his walking in it: And then a man walkes on in this way, when firſt hee neyther goeth backe, nor ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſtill: as vpon <hi>Iacobs</hi> Ladder the Angels were aſcending, or deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending;

And ſeeing Sathan is moſt fierce in our end, to hinder vs of the Crowne; therfore we ſhould be more watchfull and diligent to goe through: For if we can labour a while, we ſhall be euer ſafe, neuer feare him any more, neuer loſe that Crown, which the righteous Iudge ſhall giue vnto vs who loue his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing. So that a godly life leads a man home to Heauen, the great Citie of the great King; the end of which is reſt, and glory for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>

               <p>Firſt therefore it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that there is no Creature more enemie vnto Man, nor more able to hurt, then the Deuill; and indeed he is called the <hi>Enemie,</hi> the <hi>Murtherer,</hi>

               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:7860:200"/>
               <p>If then the Doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God importeth, that hee hath not onely ordayned in his eternall Councell the end and iſſue of his Worke, which is his Glorie, and the Saluation of his Elect; but alſo the fit meanes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his infinite VViſdome, and requiſite for execution and accompliſhment of it: Let vs be aſſured, that there is no creature that can let or alter his VVill: as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note>

It was the lifting vp of <hi>Moſes</hi> hands to heauen, which ſtrengthened <hi>Ioſua</hi> and his army,<note place="margin">Exod. 17.11</note> and gaue him victorie ouer the <hi>Amalekites;</hi> and indeed without the grace of God, that which we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by prayer, all that we doe is but vanitie. Faith is the key that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth the Cofers of the treaſures of our God. Prayer is the hand to draw it out to inrich our ſelues. Prayer lifteth vp our hearts from earth to heauen, it renueth the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of the promiſes of God to confirme vs, it aſſureth vs againſt all that we can feare, it obtaineth all that we can deſire, it giueth reſt and contentment to our ſoules, it keepeth and ſtrengtheneth the feare to offend God, it increaſeth the deſire to goe vnto him, whom in praying we feele to be the ſpring
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:7860:204"/> and fountaine of all good things: it ingendereth in vs a ſtedfaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſing of the World, and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Fleſh, it repreſenteth vnto vs the heauenly and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting felicities, that we may aſpire to the inioying of them. There is nothing more to be deſired, then to be conuerſant with him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom wee cannot be happy, but he that will alwaies bee with God, hee muſt alwaies pray or reade. For when we pray we talke with God, and when wee reade, God talketh with vs: the more we are exerciſed in Prayer to God, the more we increaſe in godlineſſe: therefore alſo we may not be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or faint-hearted in Prayer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lord deferre, to make vs feele the fruit of our Prayers, for we haue a promiſe of him that cannot lye, that whatſoeuer wee
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:7860:205"/> aske of God in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, it ſhall be giuen vs: if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre for ſome time to make vs feele the fruit of our Prayers, it is for our greater benefit. Let vs continue ſtill wayting, knowing aſſuredly, that he, according to his fatherly loue and bountie, deſireth our good, can according to his infinit power giue that which we aske of him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his truth will heare vs. He alſo according to his wiſedome knoweth the fitteſt time, as is before ſaid.<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> When we aske of God, (ſaith S. <hi>Bernard</hi>) euen thoſe things that concerne this preſent life, our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are not ſo ſoone out of our mouth, but they are written in his booke, and we ought (ſaith he) to bee aſſured, that he will either giue the thing it ſelfe which we haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or other things which hee knoweth to be more profitable for
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:7860:205"/> vs. To conclude, Prayer is the moſt mightie and fruifull work of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, ſeeing by it we help our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, preſent and abſent, knowne and vnknowne, great and little, and that both with Spirituall and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall good things, drawing by our Prayers, the bleſſing of God vpon them. Now the God of peace, that brought againe from the dead our Lord Ieſus, that great Shepheard of the Sheepe, through the blood of the euerlaſting couenant, make you perfect in euery good worke to doe his Will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, through Ieſus Chriſt. To whom be glorie for euer and euer. Amen.</p>
